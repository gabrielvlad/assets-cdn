# Assets CDN

This is a simple repo used as a personal CDN, where I can store my assets and use them on my projects.

## Usage

This CDN is used together with [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), and it can be accessed using the following link:

```html
https://www.jsdelivr.com/github
```

Basically, you just need to add the path of the file you want to access, considering the file is already present on your own github CDN so it can be loaded, like this:

```html
https://www.jsdelivr.com/github/username/repo-name/path/to/file
```
